For backend, go into ```hw5backend``` folder and run the following code in your terminal.
```javascript 
npm install
npm start
```

For angular front end, go into ```homework4``` folder and run the following code in a new terminal.
```javascript 
ng serve
```

In this homework, I REDO homework 4 by re-layout the web and add a change button to see different dog picture. Click dog link on the index file, then it will jump to 
the following page. 

When clicking on "Click to get a new dog" button, the page will generate a NEW dog picture by call route from node backend.
